# MagicPractice
Card trick simulator for practicing magic ðŸª„

## Usage
Run as a webapp on your phone or desktop. Choose either the magician or assistant views to practice that part of the trick.

## Origin
Based on the logic puzzle presented as:
> An assistant asks the audience to pick 5 random cards from a deck. The assistant then looks at the cards without showing the magician. The assistant chooses 4 of the 5 cards to show to the magician and orders them in some pre-determined way (they can't talk or communicate with the magiacian with winks or anything like that).
> 
> The magician, seeing the 4 cards and their ordering, then deduces the 5th and still hidden card.

Since there is a logical way to do this, you can perform this as an actual magic trick!
